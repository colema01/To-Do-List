# JavaScript To-Do List Application

## Overview
I developed a web-based To-Do List application using JavaScript that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed. The application is designed with a simple user interface and dynamically updates the task list as users interact with it. It demonstrates fundamental JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic array operations. Additionally, the project includes a real-time clock and highlights overdue tasks, showcasing the application's interactivity.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript for building interactive, client-side applications. By working on this project, I gained practical experience in DOM manipulation, managing events, and implementing features like task counters and date-based task reminders.

## Development Environment
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code for writing and testing JavaScript code.
- **Libraries/Tools**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Version Control**: GitHub for tracking changes and project management.

The programming language is JavaScript, which offers flexibility for building interactive web applications. I used HTML and CSS to structure and style the user interface, while JavaScript handled all the interactivity.

## Useful Websites
Here are some resources that were helpful throughout this project:

- [W3Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

## Future Work
In the future, I plan to:
- **Add a User Interface Enhancement**: Implement a more visually appealing and responsive design.
- **Integrate Local Storage**: Save tasks so they persist across sessions.
- **Add Task Categories**: Allow users to organize tasks into categories.
- **Improve Error Handling**: Add validation for user inputs and better error messages.
- **Add Subtasks**: Allow users to create subtasks under main tasks for better organization.

This project provided a solid foundation in JavaScript, and I look forward to enhancing it with these additional features.
